## Applications

### Object Detection

* Distance detection of objects
* Detect friends on images based on their facebook profiles
* Detect emotions from photos and represent them with an emoji
* Detect rotations of objects and replace them with objects that have a similar 
  rotation

### Vector Graphics

* Convert svgs as graphs to input them in neural networks
* Convert pixelbased images to vectorbased images
* [Fake Chine Characters in Vector Format with TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/28/recurrent-net-dreams-up-fake-chinese-characters-in-vector-format-with-tensorflow/)
* Create responsive Svgs via Attention Detection (see [SVG has more potential](https://madebymike.com.au//writing/svg-has-more-potential/))

### Fonts

* Font Variant Generation
